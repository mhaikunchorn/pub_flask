<h1>Pie Chart</h1>
<h5>Pie Chart Source: Pandas on PyCharm.</h5>
<p>Why: Pie charts are great for visualising part to whole relationships. In this case, presenting the percentile
    difference of the number of pubs for each borough to the total number of in London.
    <br>
    <br>Positives: It is intuitive. As it is self-explanatory, there is not a necessary need to explain what you are
    presenting.
    <br>
    <br>Negatives: For some viewers there is a lack of intuition when it comes to spatial awareness. They may struggle
    noticing area or angle unless overwhelmingly obvious.
    <br>
    <br>Alternatives: An alternative is the donut chart, this would be a small derivative improvement as it hole in the
    centre could be used to present more information such as the total number of pubs. We would opt for a more complex
    alternative such as a radial bar chart. For those who do not have spatial awareness, it would provide a clearer
    comparative analysis for decision making; it would be provide the positives of the beautiful visuals of the round
    shape, but keep the more primal/innate understanding with length for comparison.</p>
